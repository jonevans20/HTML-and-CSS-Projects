		<h1> Read This Book! </h1>
		<p> This book is extremely insightful for anyone who has ever looked up and wondered what is happening up there or for the person who ever asked the question why we spend
		all that money up there when we have problems down here to solve. It is a wonderful gateway into the understanding of how the lessons that have taken us to space have 
		directly translated to us here on this pale blue dot. </p>
	
		<h3> Listen to the Audio Book </h3>
		<p> Neil DeGrasse Tyson does a phenomenal job in his audio for this book. I am always a fan of any author who does the audio in their own audio book and Dr. Tyson's 
		reading of this book is as enthralling as his guidance in his popular television show "Cosmos".

		<h6> My Rating </h6>
		<p> I highly recommend you purchase either the book or the audio book. It will give fantastic insights and will leave you wanting more! </p>
